TTNetwork

TTNetwork is a library for writing network aware applications that 
need to handle multiple socket connections concurrently.  It is 
optimized for asynchronous protocols, that is, protocols where data 
flows bidirectionally.  It is well suited for high throughput 
applications such as media streaming, as well as its original purpose, 
P2P applications.

Where TTNetwork excels:

   - Long term rather than short term connections
   - High throughput applications
   - Asynchronous protocols

Design Goals:

   - Simple to use API that hides implementation details from the user. 
     In particular, I wanted to hide the synchronization issues 
     involved in managing multiple concurrent threads.  This allows 
     some flexibility in architecture (if, for instance, I decide later 
     to add a single threaded version of the library, it would 
     still work in much the same manner).
   - Handle two-way protocols well - where there is data streaming 
     in both directions on a single socket ( like instant messaging, 
     P2P ).
   - Portability: Compile on multiple platforms, multiple compilers.
